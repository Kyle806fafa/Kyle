    "By evaluating and comparing the original code with the improved one, I find certain improvements in terms of readability or explainability. In contrast with the original code, the new code is obviously shorter and easier, which greatly improves its readability and explainability. The original code uses too many variable names, while the new one have fewer variables with descriptive names ('winning_door', 'initial_choice', 'goat_door', 'switched_choice'). In addition, instead of repeatedly 'converting to lists' and 'removing doors', the new code list comprehensions to generate the remaining doors directly. And without unnecessary list operations and redundant code, the code improved by the chatbox is more efficient and easier to follow and read."

    " (1). ChatBot could answer me immediately after I post the question. It will explain it in detail and carefully (and gently). Sometimes, I even don't quite know what I'm trying to ask, but Chatbot will give me a whole explanation based on my description, which leads me the way and solves my confusions.\n",
    "\n",
    " (2). In my opinion, most of the time interacting with a ChatBot is helpful. However, sometimes, the things figured out by the Chatbot are frustrating or unhelpful because the Chatbot give people detailed answers and explanations instead of letting people think deeply about questions by themselves. Since a Chatbot is so powerful, people may over-rely on it, and as time goes by, their self-thinking ability will decrease.\n",
    "\n",
    " (3). Based on my own experience, Chatbot is very helpful in helping me understand the code. Sometimes there are some small errors in my code, such as missing punctuation, it will take a lot of time and enthusiasm to search on Google, but I can find them all in just a couple of seconds if I just copy and paste my code in the Chatbot. More than that, Chatbot also provides detailed explanations to almost every cell, and it will provide a better version if I ask. In conclusion, Chatbox is very useful for me to understand my code due to its efficiency and convenience."

But as a student, I love AI-driven assistance tools to learn with the reason I explained in Q6(3)."
