    "In statistics, the concepts of \"population\" and \"sample\" are similar but different. The population is the whole group of data we want to test, but it is always too large to process for us, therefore we need a sample. Sample is a small group from the population, by working on it we can draw conclusions about properties of the population even it is not as precise as processing directly from the population. \n",

In hypothesis test, we make a null hypothesis test and an alternative hypothesis test, written as H0: μ=μ0 and H1: μ≠μ1. It is obvious that we apply mean of the population here rather than the mean of sample (using μ rather than xi). Therefore, the outcomes aim to estimate the conclusion of population parameter, rather than the sample statistic!\n",

The key takeaway is that while we gather and calculate sample statistics (like \\( \\bar{x} \\)), our ultimate goal in statistical testing is to draw conclusions about the population parameter (\\( \\mu \\)).\n",
